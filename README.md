# Unveiling Senescence Driven Mechanisms in NASH Liver Using Single Cell and Embedding Based Approaches

This project investigates the role of senescent Tom+ cells in liver pathology, focusing on their contributions to inflammation and disease progression in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Leveraging UCE embeddings for precise feature integration and single-cell clustering, the research extends the findings of Omori et al. by comparing normal and NASH-affected livers. Unlike the original work, which broadly characterized senescent cells across tissues, this project employs joint clustering of senescent and non-senescent cells to uncover cell-cell interactions and transcriptional changes. By integrating tools like Multinichenet and DEG analysis, the study reveals how senescent cells influence inflammatory niches and systemic pathology, offering new insights into therapeutic interventions for liver disease.
